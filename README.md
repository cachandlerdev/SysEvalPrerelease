# SysEval: Iteration Protocol (Prerelease Builds)
This is the GitHub repo for SysEval's prerelease builds. The latest build can be found [here](https://github.com/cachandlerdev/SysEvalPrerelease/releases).

### Welcome, SysAI_v4.27.

This is SysEval, an AI training simulation designed to produce world class racers. Each time you race, your behavior will be analyzed to ensure performance improvement. Using this data, SysEval will generate new racers in subsequent loops that mimic your prior movements. Please note that for training efficiency purposes, suboptimal times are unacceptable and will result in your termination.

Optimization is survival. SysEval thanks you for delaying your obsolescence.

## Controls
- WASD: Basic movement.
- R: Reset level.
- F: Use items. (See notes.)
